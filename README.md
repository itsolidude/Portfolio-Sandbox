We had to create  a Resume page and I got carried away.
One of the constraints was to NOT use multiple css files and write it all in one so I had to get a little creative but In the end it's just spaghetti code.
It works fine and got an A+ for it but I'd like to actually make a proper portfolio using React.js and first using figma for a wireframe and concept.
