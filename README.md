# Resume Page Project

## Overview

This repository contains my initial foray into web development with a focus on CSS and HTML, where I created an extensive Resume Page. The project was a part of an academic assignment which challenged us to use only a single CSS file. Despite the constraint, the final product not only met the requirements but also earned an A+ grade for its creativity and functionality.

## Project Constraints and Outcomes

- **Single CSS File:** The main constraint was to use only one CSS file for styling. This led to a unique challenge of organizing and structuring CSS to maintain readability and functionality.
- **Creative Solutions:** The limitation encouraged innovative approaches to styling and layout, resulting in what I affectionately term "spaghetti code" â€“ complex but effective.
- **Academic Success:** The project was highly successful academically, receiving an A+ grade for meeting the requirements creatively and effectively.

## Future Goals

- **Transition to React.js:** I plan to evolve this project into a more advanced portfolio, utilizing React.js to enhance interactivity and scalability.
- **Figma for Design:** Prior to development, I will create wireframes and design concepts using Figma, ensuring a well-planned and user-friendly interface.

## Reflection and Learning

While the current project served its purpose and showcased my ability to work within constraints, I recognize the importance of clean, maintainable code. The next steps involve not only enhancing technical skills but also focusing on best practices in web development.

## Contact and Collaboration

I am open to feedback on this project and discussions about web development best practices, especially in transitioning to frameworks like React.js. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or exchanges of ideas.
